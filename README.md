# Open Source Audit Capstone Project: Python

***Student Name:** Mayank Kandpal 
***Registration Number:** 24BAI10305  
***Chosen Software:** Python  

## Project Overview
This repository contains the practical shell scripting component of the Open Source Audit capstone project [3]. It accompanies a detailed report auditing the Python programming language, including its origin story, an analysis of the Python Software Foundation (PSF) License, its footprint on a Linux filesystem, its broader FOSS ecosystem, and a comparison against proprietary alternatives like MATLAB [2, 4-6].

## Included Shell Scripts
This repository includes five Bash scripts designed to demonstrate practical Linux administration and open-source principles [7, 8].

*1. System Identity Report (⁠ system_identity.sh ⁠)*  
This script introduces the Linux system by displaying the OS name, kernel version, current logged-in user, and system uptime [7, 9, 10].  

*2. FOSS Package Inspector (⁠ package_inspector.sh ⁠)*  
This script checks whether a specified open-source tool (like Git or Python) is installed on the system, fetches its version, and prints a philosophical note about its role in the FOSS ecosystem [11, 12]. 

*3. Disk and Permission Auditor (⁠ disk_auditor.sh ⁠)*  
This script loops through important system directories (e.g., ⁠ /etc ⁠, ⁠ /var/log ⁠, ⁠ /home ⁠) and reports how much disk space each uses along with their permission settings and owner [13, 14]. 

*4. Log File Analyzer (⁠ log_analyzer.sh ⁠)*  
This script reads a system log file line by line, counts the occurrences of a specific keyword (defaulting to 'error'), and prints the most recent matching lines to help system administrators identify critical events [15, 16]. 

*5. Open Source Manifesto Generator (⁠ manifesto_generator.sh ⁠)*  
This interactive script asks the user questions about their open-source values and the "giants" whose shoulders they stand on, generates a personalized philosophy statement, and saves it to a ⁠ .txt ⁠ file [17, 18]. 

## Dependencies Required
To run these scripts, you will need:
•⁠  ⁠A Linux-based operating system (or a VM/WSL) [19].
•⁠  ⁠The ⁠ bash ⁠ shell [9].
•⁠  ⁠Standard Linux text processing and system utilities: ⁠ grep ⁠, ⁠ awk ⁠, ⁠ cut ⁠, ⁠ du ⁠, ⁠ ls ⁠, and ⁠ uptime ⁠ [9, 12, 13, 16].
•⁠  ⁠A package manager query tool (⁠ dpkg ⁠ or ⁠ rpm ⁠) depending on your Linux distribution [11, 12].

## Step-by-Step Instructions to Run the Scripts
Open your Linux terminal, clone this repository, navigate into the folder, and run the following commands [1]:

*Step 1: Make the scripts executable*
Run the following command to grant execution permissions to all script files:
⁠ chmod +x *.sh ⁠

*Step 2: Run Script 1*
⁠ ./system_identity.sh ⁠

*Step 3: Run Script 2*
⁠ ./package_inspector.sh ⁠

*Step 4: Run Script 3*
⁠ ./disk_auditor.sh ⁠

*Step 5: Run Script 4*
This script requires you to pass the path to a log file as an argument. You can also optionally pass a keyword to search for:
⁠ ./log_analyzer.sh /var/log/syslog ⁠  
(Note: Use ⁠ /var/log/messages ⁠ if on a RHEL/CentOS system, or any accessible text log file).

*Step 6: Run Script 5*
⁠ ./manifesto_generator.sh ⁠
Follow the on-screen prompts. Once finished, view your generated manifesto by typing ⁠ cat manifesto.txt ⁠ [17].
